Trophies

## Contributors:

## Description:
Handles triophies and advancements around the map.

## Location:
Main Trophy room is right next to spawn. Trophies are earnable all throughout the map.

## General Info

- Trophies **can** have multiple levels, but they don't have to.
    - if you add multiple levels, make them copper -> iron -> gold (-> diamond -> netherite)
    - reserve diamond / netherite tiers for really impressive advancements (like looking at every single build, finding all hidden goodies, stuff like that that actually requires work), don't use it for stuff like "win X minigame".
